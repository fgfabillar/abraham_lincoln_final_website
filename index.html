                        <h1>Abraham Lincoln</h1>
                        <p>Imagine a time before cars, before airplanes, even before electricity. Back in 1809, in the rugged wilderness of Kentucky, a baby boy named Abraham Lincoln was born in a simple log cabin. His family was poor, and young Abe had very little chance to go to school. But he had a burning desire to learn, walking for miles to borrow books and reading by the light of the fireplace.</p>

                        <h1>His Life</h1>
                        <h3>A Hardworking Youth</h3>
                        <p>Lincoln grew up tall and strong, working hard on the family farm. He split rails for fences – earning him the nickname "The Rail-splitter." He even worked on a flatboat, traveling down the Mississippi River. All these experiences taught him valuable lessons about hard work, honesty, and dealing with different kinds of people.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Finding His Calling in Law and Politics</h3>
                        <p>In 1830, Lincoln's family moved to Illinois, and he began to build a life for himself. He tried many jobs but eventually found his calling in law. He studied hard, passed the bar exam, and became a respected lawyer known for his fairness and common sense. He even served in the Illinois State Legislature, beginning his journey in politics.</p>
                
                        <h3>Love and Family</h3>
                        <p>Along the way, Lincoln met and fell in love with Mary Todd. They married in 1842 and had four sons, though sadly, only one would survive to adulthood. Life had its joys and sorrows for Lincoln, just like for everyone else.</p>
                
                        <h3>The Rising Star of the Republican Party</h3>
                        <p>As the nation grappled with the issue of slavery, Lincoln's strong voice against its expansion gained him national attention. He joined the new Republican Party, believing that slavery was wrong and should not be allowed to spread.</p>
                
                        <h3>The Lincoln-Douglas Debates</h3>
                        <p>In 1858, Lincoln ran for the U.S. Senate against Stephen Douglas. Their series of debates across Illinois became legendary, showcasing Lincoln's brilliant arguments against slavery. Even though he lost the election, these debates made him a national figure and set the stage for his presidential run.</p>

                            <p>This life mask captures Abraham Lincoln's gaunt and careworn appearance. Sculptor Clark Mills created the mask on February 11, 1865, during Lincoln's presidency. The detailed mask provides a rare, lifelike glimpse of Lincoln’s features from life.</p>

                            <p>Life masks were popular in the 19th century for duplicating a subject's exact features. Created from plaster molds, they offered an enduring and accurate likeness. Clark Mills’ mask preserves a moment in history with remarkable detail.</p>

                            <p>A friend of Lincoln remarked that the mask reflects <i>"one on whom sorrow and care had done their worst."</i> The lines on Lincoln’s face tell a story of the toll of leadership during a nation’s turmoil. The mask serves as a poignant reminder of Lincoln’s personal and political struggles.</p>

                        <h1>His Presidency</h1>
                        <h3>Elected President in a Divided Nation</h3>
                        <p>In 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th President of the United States. His victory, however, deeply divided the nation. Seven Southern states, furious over Lincoln's anti-slavery stance, seceded from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Civil War</h3>
                        <p>The Civil War erupted in 1861 when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina which tested Lincoln's leadership. Lincoln, determined to preserve the Union, called for troops to defend the nation. He proved to be a strong and determined leader throughout the war, making difficult decisions, appointing capable generals like Ulysses S. Grant, and inspiring the people with his words.</p>
                
                        <h3>The Emancipation Proclamation</h3>
                        <p>In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing slaves in Confederate-held territories. This was a turning point in the war, making it a fight not just for the Union, but for the freedom of all people.</p>
                
                        <h3>The Gettysburg Address</h3>
                        <p>In the same year, at the dedication of a national cemetery at Gettysburg, Lincoln delivered his most famous speech, the Gettysburg Address. In just a few powerful words, he honored the fallen soldiers and reminded everyone that the nation was fighting to ensure that <i>"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from this earth".</i> His words continue to inspire us today.</p>
                
                        <h3>Victory and a Vision for the Future</h3>
                        <p>Lincoln was re-elected in 1864 and led the Union to victory in 1865. He looked forward to rebuilding the nation and bringing the South back into the Union with kindness and forgiveness.</p>
                        
                        <h3>A Tragic End, an Enduring Legacy</h3>
                        <p>Sadly, Lincoln's vision for peace was never fully realized. Just days after the war ended, he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer. The nation was plunged into mourning, but Lincoln's legacy lived on.</p>

                            <p>Poet Richard Watson Gilder praised the life mask after Lincoln’s assassination. Gilder described it as preserving the <i>“wisdom and benignity”</i> of Lincoln’s face. This work became a poignant reminder of Lincoln’s legacy as a leader and martyr.</p>
